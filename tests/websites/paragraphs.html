    <h1>Complex paragraph example</h1>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">conceptualization</span> of quantum mechanics,
      <em>particularly</em> in the context of <strong>entanglement</strong>,
      challenges the classical notions of locality and reality. As
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank"
        >Einstein</a
      >
      famously remarked, it appears that "God does not play dice with the
      universe," yet contemporary experiments—such as those conducted by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Aspect" target="_blank"
        >Aspect</a
      >—have demonstrated the undeniable
      <span class="highlight">validity</span> of quantum correlations, defying
      classical <em>interpretations</em> and opening up new avenues for
      <strong>technological</strong>
      advancements, including quantum computing and secure communications.
