# Complex paragraph example

The conceptualization of quantum mechanics, *particularly* in the context of **entanglement**, challenges the classical notions of locality and reality. As [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) famously remarked, it appears that \"God does not play dice with the universe,\" yet contemporary experiments---such as those conducted by [Aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Aspect)---have demonstrated the undeniable validity of quantum correlations, defying classical *interpretations* and opening up new avenues for **technological** advancements, including quantum computing and secure communications.
