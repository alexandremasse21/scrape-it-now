Exception-handlers
# Exception handlers
_Added in v0.5.7_
Exceptions handlers are functions that can be assigned to your app to handle
exceptions that occur during the application runtime. They are useful for
customizing the response when an error occurs, logging errors, and performing
cleanup tasks.
## Types
Reflex support two type of exception handlers `frontend_exception_handler` and
`backend_exception_handler`.
They are used to handle exceptions that occur in the `frontend` and `backend`
respectively.
The `frontend` errors are coming from the JavaScript side of the application,
while `backend` errors are coming from the the event handlers on the Python
side.
## Register an Exception Handler
To register an exception handler, assign it to
`app.frontend_exception_handler` or `app.backend_exception_handler` to assign
a function that will handle the exception.
The expected signature for an error handler is `def handler(exception:
Exception)`.
Only named functions are supported as exception handler.
## Examples
import reflex as rx
def custom_frontend_handler(exception: Exception) -> None:
# My custom logic for frontend errors
print("Frontend Error: " + str(exception))
def custom_backend_handler(
exception: Exception,
) -> Optional[rx.event.EventSpec]:
# My custom logic for backend errors
print("Backend Error: " + str(exception))
app = rx.App(
frontend_exception_handler=custom_frontend_handler,
backend_exception_handler=custom_backend_handler,
)
